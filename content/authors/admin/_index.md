Saswat is an incoming PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Virginia. He is fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io). His research deals broadly with privacy and security; more precisely, his research interests include differential privacy and fairness, trustworthy AI (including private, fair, explainable and robust ML), cryptography, and topics related to security. 

Prior to this, he pursued an Integrated M.Sc. (BS+MS) degree at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. He also was a student researcher at the School of Computer Sciences at NISER (2021-2023).

Reach out to him anytime for discussing ideas, regarding opportunities and to give talks on his research. Open to research internship opportunities for the Summer of 2024 and collaborations in general!
