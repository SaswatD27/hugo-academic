Saswat is an incoming PhD student at [Dr. Ferdinando Fioretto's Lab](https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~ffiorett/) at the University of Virginia. His research deals broadly with privacy and security; more precisely, his research interests include differential privacy and fairness, trustworthy AI (including private, fair, explainable and robust ML), cryptography, and topics related to security. 

Prior to this, he pursued an Integrated M.Sc. (BS+MS) degree at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. He also was a student researcher at the School of Computer Sciences at NISER (2021-2023).

Reach out to him anytime to discuss research ideas and opportunities, and invitations to give talks on his research.
