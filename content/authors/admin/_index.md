Saswat Das is currently pursuing an Integrated Master's of Science degree at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. He also currently is a student researcher in [Dr. Subhankar Mishra's lab](https://www.niser.ac.in/~smishra/) (a.k.a SM Lab) at the School of Computer Sciences, NISER and at [Dr. Ferdinando Fioretto's Lab](https://web.ecs.syr.edu/~ffiorett/) at EECS, Syracuse University. His research deals broadly with privacy and security; more precisely, his research interests include differential privacy and fairness, trustworthy AI (including private, fair, explainable and robust ML), cryptography, and topics related to security.

He is based in Bhubaneswar, but spent a major chunk of his childhood in Navi Mumbai. Reach out to him anytime to discuss research ideas and opportunities, and invitations to give talks on his research interests.
