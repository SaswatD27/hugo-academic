I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) of the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) (UVA). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io) as a member of the [RAISE Group](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/) at UVA. My research interests are broadly situated within the fascinating area of trustworthy/responsible AI; more precisely, these include differential privacy, algorithmic fairness, adversarial robustness. I am also interested in cryptography and topics related to security and LLMs. 

Prior to this, I pursued an Integrated M.Sc. (BS+MS) degree at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER) with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I also was a student researcher at the School of Computer Sciences at NISER (2021-2023).

Reach out to me anytime for discussing ideas/collaborations, regarding opportunities, and to give talks on my research. I'm open to research internship opportunities as well!
