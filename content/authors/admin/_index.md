I am a PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science](https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/computer-science) of the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu) (UVA). I am fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Ferdinando Fioretto](https://nandofioretto.github.io) as a member of the [RAISE Group](https://nandofioretto.github.io/group/) at UVA. My research interests are broadly situated within the fascinating area of trustworthy/responsible AI; more precisely, these include differential privacy, algorithmic fairness, adversarial robustness. I am also interested in cryptography and topics related to security. 

Prior to this, I pursued an Integrated M.Sc. (BS+MS) degree at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. I also was a student researcher at the School of Computer Sciences at NISER (2021-2023).

Reach out to me anytime for discussing ideas, regarding opportunities and to give talks on my research. I'm open to research internship opportunities for the Summer of 2024 and collaborations in general!
