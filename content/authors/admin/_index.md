Saswat Das is currently an Integrated Master of Science student at the National Institute of Science Education and Research (NISER), an off-campus centre of Homi Bhabha National Institute, India, with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. He also currently is a student researcher in Dr. Subhankar Mishra's lab (a.k.a SM Lab) at the School of Computer Sciences, NISER. His research deals broadly with privacy and security; more precisely, his research interests include differential privacy, privacy-preserving machine learning (including differentially private machine learning and federated learning), cryptography, and network security.

He is currently based in Bhubaneswar, but spent a major chunk of his childhood in Navi Mumbai. Reach out to him anytime to discuss research ideas and opportunities, and invitations to give talks on his research.
