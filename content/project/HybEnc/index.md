Drafted n collaboration with a couple of my classmates as part of the course requirements for CS451 - Modern Cryptology (Summer, 2021) taught by Dr. Rishiraj Bhattacharyya at NISER, this term paper explores the motivation and ideas behind hybrid encryption and some pertinent algorithms and analysis.
